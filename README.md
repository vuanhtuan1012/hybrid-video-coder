# Hybrid Video Coder
This project is to implement algorithms for reduction of spatial redundancy and reduction of temporal redundancy.
## TP1: Reduction of Spatial Redundancy: Still Image
- Implementing a basic version of JPEG encoder and decoder.
- The performance of the compression is evaluated by PSNR.
- The influence of the quality factor is mentioned
- Run file [tp1.m](https://github.com/vuanhtuan1012/hybrid-video-coder/blob/master/tp1/tp1.m)

## TP2: Reduction of Temporal Redundancy: Video Sequence
- Implementing the Block Matching Algorithm (BMA) in forward prediction mode in different block sizes (8x8, 16x16, 32x32).
- Run file [tp2.m](https://github.com/vuanhtuan1012/hybrid-video-coder/blob/master/tp2/tp2.m)

## TP3: Reduction of Spatial and Temporal Redundancy: Video Sequence
- Encode videos following three cases of GoP (Group of Picture):
> - GoP = I
> - GoP = IB
> - GoP = IBB
- Run file [tp3.m](https://github.com/vuanhtuan1012/hybrid-video-coder/blob/master/tp3/tp3.m)
