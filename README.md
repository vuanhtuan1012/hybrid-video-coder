# Hybrid Video Coder
This project is to implement algorithms for reduction of spatial redundancy and reduction of temporal redundancy.
## TP1: Reduction of Spatial Redundancy: Still Image
- Implementing a basic version of JPEG encoder and decoder.
- The performance of the compression is evaluated by PSNR.
- The influence of the quality factor is mentioned

## TP2: Reduction of Temporal Redundancy: Video Sequence
- Implementing the Block Matching Algorithm (BMA) in forward prediction mode in different block sizes (8x8, 16x16, 32x32).

## TP3: Reduction of Spatial and Temporal Redundancy: Video Sequence
Encode videos following three cases of GoP (Group of Picture):
- GoP = I
- GoP = IB
- GoP = IBB
